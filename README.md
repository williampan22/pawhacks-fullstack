Hackathon website with 150+ users. Built using JavaScipt, Express.js, Node.js, MySQL, and Google OAuth. Dependcies also include Passport.js and bcrypt for authentiction when logging in. 

Implemented an application and team management system that required users to first be accepted into the hackathon. After acceptance, users could create private teams requiring invitation and acceptance from other members
or open teams where anyone could join without an invitation. Led to 30+ teams.
